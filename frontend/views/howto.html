  <h2>Welcome to Branch</h2>
  <p>
    Branch is effectively rock paper scissors with more strategy. You can use <b><strike>Inversion Points (IP)</strike> Break Points (BP) to upgrade your recruits and unlock special abilities to make things more interesting</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    To begin, click the “Battle” button at the bottom of this page or on the home screen to enter the lobby where you will be matched with the next available player.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Note</b>: If you make an account, you can also challenge your friends by entering each other’s username on the challenge screen!
  </p>
  <p>
    When entering a battle, you may choose any combination of three of the five types of classes shown below. Each class tree's third tier unit has a unique, <b>unlockable</b> ability.

    After choosing your recruits, the battle begins. Note the Atk (Attack) and Spd (Speed) values on the bottom left of each recruit card. <b>Attack is the amount of base damage</b> each recruit will do and <b>speed controls the order in which recruits will attack</b>. Ties in speed result in random ordering.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Hover over your recruits to choose their actions.</b> The top button, attack, allows you to pick your target enemy. The bottom button, defend, applies a 1/2 damage modifier to any incoming damage regardless of type.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are five types of recruits: Future (Blue), Feudal (Red), Fantasy (Green), Fanatic (Purple), and Feral (Orange). Red beats Orange and Green, Green beats Blue and Purple, Purple beats Red and Orange, Orange beats Blue and Green, and Blue beats Purple and Red.
